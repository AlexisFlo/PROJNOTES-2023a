# Creating dedicated Backend directory

## Introduction

For this activity, we must create a directory specifically for our Backend, which was already included in the projectÂ´s creation. In this case, we will be using Express (which is the most popular web framework for Node, and is the underlying library for many other popular Node web frameworks)

## Methods

The first thing we will do is create a directory called "server" (it can be created either from the terminal or from Visual). Once created, we will move the following files inside it:
 - bin.
 - routes.
 - views.
 - app.js.

**What are middlewares?**

Middlewares are functions that can be executed before the final request handler function is called. They can modify the request and response objects, execute additional code, or terminate the request-response cycle.
You can also create custom middlewares using app.use() or router.use() methods. These methods take a function as an argument that will be executed for every incoming request.

Then, we use the app.use() method to apply the middleware function to all incoming requests. Finally, we define a route handler for the root path and start the server.

When you run this code and make a request to the server, you should see the request method and URL logged to the console.

## Results

After completing the previous steps, a specific directory is obtained for the Backend, allowing for a better project structure, making it look more professional.

## Discussions

It is necesary to remember that when moving these folders and files within the Server, the paths in some files must be modified. It is also important that when running in Dev mode, it is necessary to modify as mentioned above
