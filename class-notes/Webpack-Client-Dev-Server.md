# Webpack Client Dev Server

# Introduction

Webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. Since webpack understands only JavaScript and JSON files, it transforms front-end assets such as HTML, CSS, and images into valid modules if the corresponding loaders are included. While processing your application webpack internally builds a dependency graph that maps every module your project needs and produces one or more output bundles

# Methods

At the root of the project, we will create a file with the following name: ./webpack.config.js
The startup script for the front-end development server is created, we will call it dev-c from the term development client.

We will first proceed to create a directory called ./client for the front-end source code. Within that directory, we will create a file called ./client/index.js

Is useful when you want to ensure that an objectÂ´s properties remain constant throughout your code, especially in larger codebases where it can be difficult to keep track changes to objects. By freezing an object, you can be sure that it will not change unexpectedly, making your code more predictable and easier to reason about.

## Discussions

Webpack is a powerful tool for bundling and managing JavaScript modules in modern web development. It allows developers to organize their code into manageable pieces and optimize the performance of their applications. By automating tasks such as transpilation, minification, and code splitting, webpack greatly simplifies the process of building complex web applications.
