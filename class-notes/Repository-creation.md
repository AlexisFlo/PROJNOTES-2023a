# Repository creation

## Introduction

In this section we will see the process we must follow to create our repository on GitHub and be able to work locally or remotly.

## Methods

Once we have met the requirements scpecified in the [Project creation](https://github.com/AlexisFlo/PROJNOTES-2023a/blob/main/class-notes/Project-creation.md) note, we will follow these steps:

1. Go to our GitHub account.
2. Create a new repository by selecting "New" or clicking on the "+" icon.
3. Select **New repository**
4. Choose a name, add a brief description, and select "Public".
5. Select "Add a README file".
6. Under "Add .gitignore", select the "Node" option.
7. Under "License", select "MIT".
8. Click **Create repository**

Once created we can work directly on GitHub using Codespaces, or we can work locally by cloning the repository. However, we will use Codespaces to work on the project.
Click on the *< > Code* button, select **Create codespace on main**, and wait for it load.

Once the editor is open, we will see our **README.md** and **.gitignore** files. In our README, we will add a brief introduction about the project, a link to information about ourselves, a section for project notes (linked through links); we will create a new folder called **class-notes** that will house our project notes, and the first file we will add is **Project-creation.md**, and the second file will be called **Repository-creation.md**

## Results

The results of these instructions are the creation of a new repository on GitHub, with a **README** file,  **.gitignore** file, and **MIT** license. The project can be worked on either directly on GitHub Codespaces, or by cloning the repository and working on it locally. The instructions also include creating two new files within the **README**: "**Project-creation.md**" and "**Repository-creation.md**". The **README** should also contain a brief introduction about the project, a link to information about the creators, and a section for project notes with links to the relevant files in the "**class-notes**" folder.

## Discussions

1. The importance of creating a clear and organized structure for a project repository on GitHub. By following these steps, users can ensure that their project repository has all the necessary files, such as a **README** file, a **.gitignore** file, and a license, as well as a clear folder structure for their project notes.
2. The benefits of using Codespaces to work on a project. Codespaces allows users to work directly on GitHub, whitout needing to download and set up a local development enviroment. This can be especially useful for collaborative projects, as it allows team members to work on the same codebase in real-time.
3. the significanse of choosing an appropiate license for a project. By selecting the "**MIT**" license, users can ensure that their code is open source and can be used by others, while still retaining some control over how it is used and distributed.

Overall, these steps provide a solid foundation for creating and managing a project repository on GitHub, and can help ensure that the project is well-organized, accessible, and easy to collaborate on.
